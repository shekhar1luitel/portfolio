# Portfolio

This repository contains a single-page portfolio inspired by the layout of [aaadaaam.com](https://aaadaaam.com) and adapted for Adam Doe, a creative technologist.

## Development

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the project with a simple static server, e.g.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

The page uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Styles live in `styles/main.css` and JavaScript enhancements (navigation toggle and scroll spy) in `scripts/main.js`.
